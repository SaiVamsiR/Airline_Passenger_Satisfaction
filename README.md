# Airline_Passenger_Satisfaction
## Overview

This project aims to analyze airline passenger satisfaction data to understand factors influencing passenger satisfaction and to develop predictive models to forecast passenger satisfaction levels. The dataset used for this analysis contains various attributes related to airline services, flight experiences, and passenger demographics.

## Goals

The main goals of this project are:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features and their relationships with passenger satisfaction.
2. Feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling.
3. Building predictive models to forecast passenger satisfaction.
4. Evaluating model performance and selecting the best performing model.
